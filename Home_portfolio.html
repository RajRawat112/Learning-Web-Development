        <p class="about">
            A spirited 19-year-old tech aficionado
            hailing from the vibrant city of Calgary, Alberta. Currently, 
            I'm in the midst of my second exhilarating year at the University 
            of Calgary, where I'm soaking up knowledge and shaping my path in 
            the world of technology. My journey so far has been peppered with 
            thrilling projects that reflect my passion for innovation. One of 
            my standout creations is a dynamic PSO (Particle Swarm 
            Optimization) system, where I harnessed the power of algorithms 
            to tackle complex problems with elegance. On another front, 
            I whipped up a nifty grade calculator that's been a lifesaver 
            for many fellow students, streamlining the academic journey. 
            But that's not all â€“ I've also woven my skills into a captivating 
            personal website portfolio, showcasing my prowess in HTML and 
            CSS, while adding a dash of SQL wizardry to make it truly 
            interactive. When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll 
            find me embracing the outdoors, soaking up inspiration from 
            nature to fuel my boundless creativity. With a strong command of 
            Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and SQL, I'm all set to continue crafting 
            digital marvels that leave a mark. Here's to a thrilling ride 
            through the tech cosmos! ðŸš€
